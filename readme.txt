A helper plugin to contain your MainWP Dashboard custom code snippets.

== Description ==

The MainWP Customisations plugin is designed to contain your custom snippets for the [MainWP Dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp/) plugin. By adding custom snippets to this plugin, you can easily extend your MainWP Dashboard functionality or change the way it looks.

It will help you to keep all your changes in one location and independent of the other components. This will enable you to safely update your MainWP Dashboard plugin and theme on your MainWP Dashboard site without of worry of losing your modifications as well as deactivating your custom code if needed for troubleshooting.

For the MainWP function reference, please check the [MainWP Codex](https://codex.mainwp.com).
